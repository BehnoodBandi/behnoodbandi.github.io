            The Cosmology Redshift Survey of the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST-{CRS}) will provide redshift measurements of galaxies and quasars over 5800 \${\textbackslash}rm \{deg{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\$ in the southern hemisphere. As targets for the 4MOST-{CRS}, we present a selection of an r \&lt; 19.25 magnitude-limited sample of Bright Galaxies ({BG}) and a colour selected sample of Luminous Red Galaxies ({LRG}) based on {DESI} Legacy Surveys {DR}10.1 photometric data, in the redshift ranges 0.1 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.5 and 0.4 \&lt; z \&lt; 1, respectively. These samples are selected using the g, r, z, and W1 (from {unWISE}) photometric bands. For {BGs}, the star–galaxy separation is performed based on Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues. Following 4MOST requirements, the target densities of {BGs} and {LRGs} are 250 \${\textbackslash}rm \{deg{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ and 400 \${\textbackslash}rm \{deg{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$, respectively. We quantified the stellar contamination to be \&lt;2 − 4\% for both galaxy samples using data from the first {DESI} data release. Using angular clustering, we show that both samples are robust against imaging systematics, confirming a low stellar contamination. Finally, we provide forecasts of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ({BAO}) and growth of structure (σ8) measurements from the 4MOST-{CRS} alone and in combination with {DESI}. From the 4MOST-{CRS}, we expect 3\% and 25\% precision on {BAO} and σ8 measurements, respectively. Combining 4MOST-{CRS} with {DESI} improves the constraints from {DESI} alone by 12\% in the 0.4 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.8 redshift range, leading to the most stringent constraints on {BAO} measurements from spectroscopic galaxy clustering.},
