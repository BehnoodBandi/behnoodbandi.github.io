CRS BG and LRG target selection and angular clustering	Collaboration meeting talk	crs-bg-lrg-target-selection-angular-clustering	4MOST Science Team Meeting	2025-02	Naples, Italy	NaN	The Cosmology Redshift Survey (4MOST-CRS) will enable precision cosmological measurements using spectroscopic clustering of galaxies and quasars over 0.1 < z < 2.5 across >7000 deg^2. This talk presented the CRS Bright Galaxy and Luminous Red Galaxy target selections and angular clustering tests used to assess catalogue quality and uniformity.
Angular two-point correlation function of Euclid Early Data	Collaboration meeting talk	euclid-early-data-angular-2pcf	Euclid Galaxy Clustering Meeting	2025-01	Garching, Germany	NaN	Presented measurements of the angular two-point correlation function using Euclid Early Data, focusing on methodology, early catalogue validation, and key systematic checks relevant to clustering analyses.
Mapping the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of Sky Surveys	Outreach talk	mapping-the-universe-sky-surveys	Astronomy Festival @ Herstmonceux Observatory	2025-08-28	Herstmonceux, East Sussex, UK	NaN	A public talk on how sky surveys evolved from early star catalogues to modern projects such as Gaia, 4MOST, DESI, LSST, and Euclid, and how these surveys help answer questions about galaxy growth, dark energy, and the cosmic web.
