The Cosmology Redshift Survey (4MOST-CRS) will enable precision cosmological measurements using spectroscopic clustering of galaxies and quasars over 0.1 < z < 2.5 across >7000 deg^2. This talk presented the CRS Bright Galaxy and Luminous Red Galaxy target selections and angular clustering tests used to assess catalogue quality and uniformity.
